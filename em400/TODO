Known bugs:

CPU:

* AWP - sign storage, floating point instructions

Debugger:

* again, rethink hex/dec numbers in output and log
* HLT will halt debugger too if there is no interrupt to serve
* debugger in separate thread (?)
* use status bar for panel leds (?)
* inform user which interrupt is being served (if any)
* inteligent memory view (auto-scroll)
* scrollable memory/dasm/stack views (?)
* IPS counter
* macro for accessing interrupt states (for brk) (?)
* save memory image
* load/save snapshot (?)
* step should work the same way as CYCLE (cycle on instruction and interrupt) (?)

Other:

* autotests

MERA-400 features that em400 does not emulate:

* timings (instructions, memory access, disk latencies, serial lines)
* power failure interrupts (cpu and channel)
* 2-cpu configuration
  * interrupts
  * gil/giu instructions
  * bit 11 of SR
  * channel interrupt masks for 2 cpus
  * device allocations per cpu
* memory parity (itself and interrupts)
* priority based interface reservation
* operator panel
