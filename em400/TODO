Known bugs:


CPU:

* HLT should wait for unmasked interrupts only (?)
* interrupts served only when P=0, MOD=0, ...
* AWP - sign storage, floating point instructions

Debuger:

* logging
* inform user which interrupt is being served (if any)
* memory/registers untraced when accessed by i/o devices
* inteligent memory view (auto-scroll)
* scrollable memory/dasm/stack views (?)
* IPS counter
* macro for accessing interrupt states (for brk)
* save memory image
* load/save snapshot (?)
* step should work the same way as CYCLE (cycle on instruction and interrupt) (?)

Other:

* autotests

MERA-400 features that em400 does not emulate:

* timings (instructions, memory access, disk latencies, serial lines)
* power failure interrupts (cpu and channel)
* 2-cpu configuration
  * interrupts
  * gil/giu instructions
* memory parity (itself and interrupts)
* priority based interface reservation
* operator panel
