EM400 is an attempt to create emulation of Polish MERA-400 minicomputer system,
built in late '70 and popular in the '80. See: http://mera400.pl

Currently, project is in highly development state, that means emulation is:

* incomplete
* inaccurate
* unoptimized

Basically, there is nothing interesting you can do with it at the moment. :-)
