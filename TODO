Known bugs:

Cleanups:
* pre-modification vs. SHC
* pre-modification vs. EXL and NRF
* "microoperationalize" and verify instruction flow against memory errors (what comes after what): EXL, LIP, SP

Code enhancements (possible):

* librarize
* make em400 C++ friendly

Features (possible):

* graphical control panel interface
* snapshot save/restore
* new debugger interface (qt)
* integrate local console(-s) into user interface
* deeptrace
* conditional logging

CPU:

* review cpu cycle in context of interrupt handling
* no-elwro configuration
* overlaid elwro/mega configuration

I/O:

* speed_real (disk latencies, serial lines, ...)
* handling no memory for io devices
* cmem
* cchar
* plix
* terminal (console, tcp, serial)
* MULTIX:
  * winchester:
    * one controller for all drives (?)
    * spare sectors area (requires h/w marking sectors as bad and sector addresses)
    * formatting (and handling unformatted drive - requires h/w formatting)
    * spare area formatting (and handling of sector migration - requires h/w work)

To clarify:

* 2-cpu configuration

MERA-400 features that em400 does not emulate:

* power failure interrupts (cpu and channel)
* 2-cpu configuration:
  * interrupts
  * gil/giu instructions
  * bit 11 of SR
  * channel interrupt masks for 2 cpus
  * device allocations per cpu
  * multix 2cpu interrupt queue
* memory parity (itself and interrupts)
* interface:
  * as a communication bus
  * reservation
  * priorities
* MULTIX:
  * SOM protocols
